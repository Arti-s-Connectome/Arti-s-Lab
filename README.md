# Artilab
- Artilab is a Java desktop app for designing, researching, and testing neuron and neural network models. Currently, it is a very new program under development, and it is intended to become our flagship research and development app.
- Artilab requires JavaFX v23 and Java SDK v22.
- A runnable JAR file for Artilab will be provided in the future.

# Completed
Izhikevich Neuron Lab
- This lab environment allows for the creation and testing of Izhikevich spiking models.
- Izhikevich's standard 20 spiking models are preprogrammed into the lab.
- New models can be created and saved for later testing or use in the Neural Network Lab.

# In-development
Neural Network Lab
- This lab will allow for the creation and testing of neural networks, using Izhikevich's spiking models and our proximal and distal dendrite models.
- This lab will feature a neural network display GUI that allows for the visual design, construction, and testing of neural networks.
- Created neural networks will be able to be saved to the user's system.
- Specialized data input functionality will be built into the lab to give neural networks various data sources and modalities for testing.
