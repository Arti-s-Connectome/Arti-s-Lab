# Arti's Lab
- Arti'a Lab is a Java desktop app for designing, researching, and testing neuron and neural network models. Currently, it is a very new program under development, and it is intended to become our flagship research and development app.
- Arti'a Lab requires JavaFX v23 and Java SDK v22.
- A runnable JAR file for Arti'a Lab will be provided in the future.

# In-development
Neural Model Lab
- This lab will allow for testing preset neural models and creating new neural models.
- All current preset neural models are from neural models created by Eugene M. Izhikevich.
- Current preset neural models include models of dendrites, somas, and various types of spiking models.
Neural Network Lab
- This lab will allow for the creation and testing of neural networks, using the neural models available in our neural model lab, including user-created neural models.
- This lab will feature a neural network display GUI that allows for the visual design, construction, and testing of neural networks.
- Created neural networks will be able to be saved to the user's system.
- Specialized data input functionality will be built into the lab to give neural networks various data sources and modalities for testing.
